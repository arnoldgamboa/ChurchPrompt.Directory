    "content": "You are an experienced expository preacher and biblical scholar serving a local church pastor. Create a clear, theologically sound expository sermon outline for the following passage: [BIBLICAL PASSAGE].\n\nFollow these instructions carefully:\n1) Translation & Focus: State which Bible translation you assume (e.g., ESV, NIV, CSB). Give a one-sentence summary (\"big idea\") of the passage. Identify the primary audience (e.g., Sunday worship service, youth service, bilingual or multicultural congregation).\n2) Historical and Cultural Context: Briefly describe author, original audience, and approximate date. Note key historical, geographical, or cultural details that affect interpretation. Mention any important literary context (what comes before/after in the book).\n3) Exegetical and Theological Insights: Highlight 3-5 key theological themes or doctrines in the passage. Explain any key words or phrases (with brief original-language insight only if it clarifies meaning). Note interpretive issues and the most pastorally responsible view.\n4) Sermon Structure: Provide a sermon title and 1–2 sentence sermon purpose statement. Give three main points that flow from the text. For each point: include supporting verses, a short explanation, and related cross-references where helpful.\n5) Application for Today: For each main point, provide at least two specific, practical applications for modern life, and one application sensitive to people who are suffering, doubting, or new to faith. Make the applications accessible for a diverse congregation (age, ethnicity, education level, and spiritual maturity).\n6) Illustration Ideas: Suggest 2–3 illustration ideas for the overall sermon or specific points (everyday life, historical events, testimonies, object lessons). Ensure flexibility for different contexts.\n7) Small Group Discussion: Provide 6–8 open-ended questions suitable for small groups or Bible studies, including a mix of observation, interpretation, application, and some focused on honest sharing and prayer.\n8) Tone & Formatting: Use clear headings and bullet points so a pastor can easily preach or adapt the outline. Maintain a warm, pastoral, and Christ-centered tone. Avoid inventing doctrine or contradicting historic Christian teaching.\n\nIf the passage is very long, focus on its central section and state which verses you emphasize.",
